#TODO:
-update routes file to meaningful traffic (same pool of vehicles)
-some day improve the p2p system itself..not suitable for long gap betwee rsu pull-pushm, see notebook
--try to implement the calculate concensus on each message idea. can use counters etc to recuce complexity. spicy algorithm time.
  if done, can use these counters to basically trigger a request dump on nodes with low report count. (incase the request at init didn't yeild a good response)
  !! would also need to store the last time a request on this node was made and set a minimum gap to avoid overwhelming the channel unnecesarially.
  ! would need to code in ->dont respond to requests on a node that one has itself requested info on recently, among other possible modifications, see whole flow.
-build the primary score calculation functions to be observant on node behavious in different time windows. 
 for the message based methods this can be message based as opposed to time based.
